<h2>RUNJHUN & KAMALAKAR HANUMANTHU</h2>
<h3>VIZAG, VIJAYAWADA & GUNTUR</h3>
<p>We have been in partnership with Pepperfry since 2020,
   when we launched our first Franchisee Studio with them 
   in Vizag. With the smooth experience we had, we
   launched our second studio at Vijayawada and our 3 rd 
   studio at Guntur. it has been a great journey. The team at 
   Pepperfry has been very supportive right from the time we signed-up.
   We are happy to partner with Indiaâ€™s leading home and furniture marketplace.</p>

  <h2>SAMUEL GEORGE</h2>
  <h3>TRIVANDRUM, MADURAI, KOLLAM & THIRUVALLA</h3>
  <p>
    Partnering with Pepperfry proved to be a game-changer 
    for my existing business. The team at Pepperfry helped me set up 
    the entire studio and functions in a matter of 45 days. We launched 
    Studio Pepperfry at Trivandrum, in Dec 2018 and had 3,500 customers
    within a year of its launch. Since then, I launched three more 
    Pepperfry Franchisees. With Pepperfry, we can deliver anywhere in India.
     We now cater to the whole of India as a market.

    <h2>VAISHNAVEE S & GURUPRASAD</h2>
    <h3>COIMBATORE, OMR(CHENNAI), E-CITY (BANGALORE), ANNA NAGAR (CHENNAI) & PONDICHERRY</h3>
    <p>
      While researching for business opportunities, we came across 
      Pepperfry. We wanted to weigh it right, so two weeks on, we visited 
      their Mumbai Head Office. We were so impressed with the experience 
      that we signed up for the franchisee and on the 42nd day, Studio 
      Pepperfry Coimbatore was Open for Business. We have been in 
      partnership with Pepperfry since 2019 and today we have 5 franchisee 
      studios with them.
