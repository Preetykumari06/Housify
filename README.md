About Our Project :

Our project is a clone of www.pepperfry.com, where we can purchase home decor and all furniture products.

Guide to Project:

On the Home page, Navbar is there for navigating to all the pages. The Navigation Bar contains a mega Drop-Down from which one can select a particular Category to purchase. After choosing a particular category, it takes us to a new page where the user will be able to see lots of products and we can filter the products based on their category. After selecting a product, the User can see the detailed information about the product and can add it to the cart if he or she finds any particular product of his or her 
Credit: interest.

There is also a login functionality where the user can sign up by using 10 digit mobile number, after entering the mobile number then redirects to the information page where the user can fill in their details, which details gonna saved in the local storage. So this is basically our project. We were five members in the team and we completed the whole project in the construction week.
